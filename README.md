## How it works
This script replaces the man (macros to format man pages) and save some disc space due this tool use online documents instead of keep then into the disc (HDs, SSDs, Live Discs and others).

Seems like silly I know! But nowadays we already use the cloud to store our stuffs, so why not also the linux manuals? I hope you enjoy. 

## How install
### Download the manpgs main script file
