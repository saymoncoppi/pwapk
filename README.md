## How it works
This script build a new apk based on orifginal pwa url. \
It gets the base files from a new one project, create resourse files, keystores, pack, align, assign and deliver the APK for you, for free and using no Android Studio to do the Magic.

Seems a bit silly I know but I hope you enjoy.
